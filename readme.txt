Suppress Skimlinks on post or pages, whether the whole content or just a portion.

== Description ==

Skimlinks is a great way to easily monetize content by converting product links in your post into their equivalent affiliate links on-the-fly. Indeed, Skimlinks does a lot more than this. If you're not already signed up, [sign up here](http://go.skimlinks.com/?id=15437X720702&xs=1&url=http://skimlinks.com "Skimlinks")!

You can add Skimlink functionality to your site via code that they provide or  [their official plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/skimlinks/ "Skimlinks WordPress Plugin"). However, you may find that in some circumstances (e.g. a sponsored post) you may be asked to suppress any such advertising. Although Skimlinks provides a means to do this the functionality is not included in their plugin. Et voilà, this plugin does just that - where you need it to, it will suppress any Skimlink output on a page or post basis.

To use - and this is where it couldn't get simpler - just add the shortcode [noskim] around the content. For example...

`[noskim]Post or page contents where I don't want Skimlinks advertising[/noskim]`

Simple, eh?

Alternatively, if you wish to switch off Skimlinks for the entire post or page in one swift stroke, then look for the meta box within the editor screen named 'No Skim' and tick the option within it. Can't find the box? Read the FAQ for details.

== Installation ==

No Skim can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration. Alternatively, it can be downloaded and installed manually...

1. Upload the entire `no-skim` folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. That's it, you're done - you just need to add the shortcode!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use other shortcodes within the noskim shortcodes? =

Yep.

= Is this an official plugin from Skimlinks? =

No. I'm not affiliated with Skimlinks at all, just happy a happy user!

= Where do I find the No Skim box in the editor? =

Ok, assuming you're in the post or page editor then where it is depends on how you have the screen configured - it could be anywhere, to be honest, but usually appears somewhere beneath the main editor screen.

If you still can't find it, click on the "Screen options" tab in the top, right hand corner and ensure the "Code Embed" box is ticked - once it is, it will definitely be somewhere on your screen.
