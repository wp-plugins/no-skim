== Description ==

Skimlinks is a great way to easily monetize content by converting product links in your post into their equivalent affiliate links on-the-fly. Indeed, Skimlinks does a lot more than this. If you're not already signed up, [sign up here](http://go.skimlinks.com/?id=15437X720702&xs=1&url=http://skimlinks.com "Skimlinks")!

You can add Skimlink functionality to your site via code that they provide or  [their official plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/skimlinks/ "Skimlinks WordPress Plugin"). However, you may find that in some circumstances (e.g. a sponsored post) you may be asked to suppress any such advertising. Although Skimlinks provides a means to do this the functionality is not included in their plugin. Et voil√†, this plugin does just that - where you need it to, it will suppress any Skimlink output on a page or post basis.

To use - and this is where it couldn't get simpler - just add the shortcode [noskim] around the content. For example...

[noskim]Post or page contents where I don't want Skimlinks advertising[/noskim]

Simple, eh?

== Licence ==

This WordPress plugin is licensed under the [GPLv2 (or later)](http://wordpress.org/about/gpl/ "GNU General Public License").

== Installation ==

No Skim can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration. Alternatively, it can be downloaded and installed manually...

1. Upload the entire `no-skim` folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. That's it, you're done - you just need to add the shortcode!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use other shortcodes within the noskim shortcodes? =

Yep. 

= Is this an official plugin from Skimlinks? =

No. I'm not affiliated with Skimlinks at all, just happy a happy user!

= What's next? =

Most times you'll need to use this, I suspect, will be to suppress Skimlinks across an entire post or page, rather than just a section of it. I therefore want to add a meta box that will allow you to simply a box to switch it off for the post/page, to save having to use the shortcode.
